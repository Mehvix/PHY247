Data taken using phyphox and my galaxy s10e.

Used accelerometer, linear acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer. 

Data colletion rate set as high as possible.

Each folder contains data sets for a large initial angle and a small angle. Videos accompany each of these to give you an idea for what kind of an angle you're dealing with.

My phone was taped up in the same spot for all of the data sets.

Note that in the pictures for the length of the pendulum, the reading on top is really something like 170cm rather than 70cm.
