In each folder, you'll find videos showing the motion of the glider for different initial amplitudes (8cm,11cm,14cm,17cm)

The video was filmed at 30 frames per second.

Find some sort of software that allows you to go through the video frame by frame, or perhaps watching in slow motion. I believe matlab has a feature that allows you to do this.

If you aren't able to get this to work within a reasonably short amount of time, then ask John for the frames.
