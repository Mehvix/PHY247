Each of these folders contains pictures and a video corresponding to modes 1 through 5, with 200g of weights + a 50g hanger.

These pictures will be labeled something like 

"54_1.png" or "54_2.png"

The first number refers to the frequency with which the pasco was driving the string.

The second number is just an extra label to break the degeneracy between the two pictures.

One of the two picture corresponds to the top of the string's oscillation. The other picture will correspond to the bottom. You can use the position of the string in these two pictures to estimate the amplitude of the oscillation at the given frequency. 

I had to turn down the amplitude in order to minimize non-linear effects in the oscillation of the string. This may make things difficult to see. So, don't worry too much if your higher order results don't look great. It is what it is...
