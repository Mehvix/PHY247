Each data set contains 4 different measurements:

One with no shielding

One with a single 1mm sheet of aluminum as shielding 

One width two 1mm sheets of aluminum as shielding

One width three 1mm sheets of aluminum as shielding.

Each data set I collected was taken with the geiger counter at a different distance from the source, so don't be suprised if your results look different than your partners' results.
